# TurisCunha
üåç Discover Cunha like never before! My goal is to create an interactive website that helps both tourists and locals discover the newest and best places to visit, tailored to different travel styles. The site will include location details, maps, opening hours, and more. Users will be able to plan their trips directly on the platform by selecting attractions they want to visit and receiving an estimated cost.

This is my first original project built from scratch. I'm doing it to teach myself how to code and to start thinking like a programmer.

If you'd like to contribute ideas or collaborate with me, you're more than welcome! I also plan to turn this project into a mobile app in the future.
